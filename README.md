============
Background:
-----------
When I first started being the stay home dad in a Pandemic stricken world I was faced with a new challenge. Cooking. For many years I was too busy to step into this part of my family life. I was nervous. My kids were ... nervous.  And my wife ... she said I needed a plan.

I wanted something fancy and available online, yet found nothing for free. I ended up using paper and weekly questioning of my wife and kids to see what they wanted, when they wanted it and had to watch the reactions during mealtime to see if they liked it or not. After several weeks of cooking I ended up with a stack of papers flying loosly around and decided to enter the info into a googlesheets speadsheet. 

That is where the idea for this app was concieved and dreamt up. Standing in the kitchen painstakingly trying to figure out what to cook each week.

So this is a journey to make my life (hopefully) easier.
